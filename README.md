# Graphics-Library
A library of functions written in arm assembly to draw basic shapes in a framebuffer. A framebuffer is a 2d memory buffer used in video cards where each memory location represents a pixel on the screen. The shape is first drawn in the framebuffer by saving corresponding values in the memory locations and then this buffer is transferred to the screen for display.
